# My Simple Tools

Some task that I need to do on a daily basis require me to have multiple external tools open at once.  Those tools do not always have every piece of functionality I am looking for.  This repository holds self-made tools instead.  

## Tools

- [JWT Parser](#jwt-parser)


### JWT Parser

The JWT Parser will consume JSON Web Tokens and display their payload and header.  This tool takes over for the jwt.io web utility.  This feature improves on the jwt.io utility by providing an expanded version of the payload, including a copy button, and a parse button.  This allows me to copy a property from the token quickly and if there is a nested token, quickly parse that token as well.

In addition, the `save` button allows me to store tokens and retrieve them, allowing me to work with multiple tokens at once if I am inspecting and comparing tokens.
